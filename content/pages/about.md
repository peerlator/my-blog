Hi, I'm Peer!

I'm currently going to high school in Berlin. In the past 4 years I have spend a lot of time coding and tinkering around with technology. Throughout those 4 years I have explored differend areas of coding, inluding IOS app development, web development and Artificial Inteligence. I'm also very interested in making my development environment as efficient as possible. That's why I use a tiling window manager and emacs.
